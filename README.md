## Pain Points

1. **Non-official partners**

> International, Beyond-gender couple etc.

> An increasing number of partners are not officially recognized.

2. **Difficult to know backgrounds** 

> It is difficult to know the relationship history, such as meeting on social media, so

> there are no any mutual friends, so can't know each other until they've known each other for a long time.

3. **Unclear Start/Stop relationship**

> It's hard to tell when a relationship between two people begins and ends.

1. **Any couple can be official.**

> Anyone can be verified their relationship publicly through transactions.

2. **Able to ask exs like a Telephone book.** 

> You can ask past lovers and get to know the other person faster.

3. **TimeStamped relationship**

> By minting (expiring) the NFT issued by one party, the beginning and end are made official
and cannot be changed.
