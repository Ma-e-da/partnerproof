## Description



## How it's made



## Pain Points

1. **Non-official partners**

> International, Beyond-gender couple etc.

An increasing number of partners are not officially recognized.

3. **Difficult to know backgrounds** 

> It is difficult to know the relationship history, such as meeting on social media, so

there are no any mutual friends, so can't know each other until they've known each other for a long time.

5. **Unclear Start/Stop relationship**

> It's hard to tell when a relationship between two people begins and ends.
